# Chronoelegy

### This mod is intended as a standalone experience with its own builtin map, do NOT add this to your modpack.

**This project is VERY work in progress and does not contain a lot of gameplay at the moment.**

Chronoelegy is a short game revolving around time travel, movement.

I made this to learn more about modding especially rendering.

### Current Features:
* A fully reworked movement system with wallrunning, sliding and more
* Some fancy shaders (SSAO, Bloom, Motion Blur, Depth Of Field)
* A special blade that allows you to satisfyingly slash trough enemies and grapple
* A dialogue system
* Custom cursors
* A custom title screen
* A checkpoint system
* Some clocks with special properties
* A table that can be resized and allows you to display items
* A jump pad
* A speedrunning hud with time and speed

#### Known compatible Mods:
Stfu, Entity Culling, FerriteCore, Lithium

**Do NOT add sodium or modmenu**
